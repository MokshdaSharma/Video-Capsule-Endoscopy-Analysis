# *Video Capsule Endoscopy Analysis* 
AI-Powered Video Capsule Endoscopy Analysis: Detect abnormalities, generate reports, and assist doctors with automated insights.

### *Overview*
Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) Analysis is an AI-powered tool designed to detect abnormalities in endoscopic images using deep learning. It automates the diagnostic process, providing detailed medical insights and generating professional reports.

Traditional endoscopy requires manual analysis by medical professionals, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project enhances diagnostic accuracy, speeds up the evaluation process, and ensures consistent analysis, making it a valuable tool for healthcare providers.

Users upload an endoscopic image through a web interface. The AI model, trained on medical datasets, classifies abnormalities with confidence scores. The system then retrieves detailed information, including potential causes, precautions, and treatment recommendations. Finally, it generates a downloadable PDF report for further medical use.
